## Introduction

Purrfit is a Discord bot designed to cater to the health-conscious gaming community. It serves as a dynamic reminder system integrated seamlessly into the gaming experience. By employing customizable reminders, activity tracking, and motivational guidance, this bot empowers gamers to strike an optimal balance between their gaming engagements and physical well-being.

## Background

Discord is a widely-used communication platform for gamers, providing free voice and text chat across desktop, mobile, and web. Discord bots automate tasks and provide information, and Purrfit aims to address the physical health concerns of gamers who spend long hours gaming.

## Problem Space

### Problem Background

- About 60% of gamers play games daily or several times a week, with sessions lasting over 2 hours.

- Main concerns include poor posture, visual and physical discomfort.
- Major barriers include time constraints, low awareness, and lack of motivation.

Given these findings, there's a clear need for solutions like Purrfit to promote healthy habits among gamers.

## Product Implementation

### Hosted Platform

- Frontend: Vercel
- Backend: Render
- Bot: TBD

### Tech Stack Used

- Database: MongoDB
- Backend: Express
- Frontend: React
- Bot: Discord.js
- Package Manager: Node.js

### Technical Challenges

- Frontend development faced a challenge when working with graphs, a new task for the team.
- The discovery of Chart.js, a user-friendly library, simplified graph creation, dispelling the misconception that it was difficult.

### Scaling Challenges

- The app encounters scalability challenges due to its current hosting setup.
- Backend is hosted on Render, a free platform, while Discord operates in a Sandbox with limitations and unpredictability.
- Deploying on a more reliable platform like Google Cloud could become costly.

### Addressing Scaling Challenges

To overcome these scalability issues, our team is focusing on enhancing the app's value. We plan to introduce new and valuable features to both the bot and the website. Our goal is to entice users into subscribing to a premium service, which will help cover expenses and ensure the app runs smoothly.

### Key Takeaways

- Working as a team has been a valuable learning experience for us.
- We've come to appreciate the importance of meetings in the development process.
- Collaborating with a diverse team, including a product manager, product designer, backend developer, frontend engineer, and mentor, has taught us how to efficiently and swiftly create a high-quality product.

## Future Plans

- Enhancing Performance: We're enhancing our app speed and ironing out issues for smoother use.
- Rewards Ahead: Soon, earn cool rewards like game skins or vouchers just for using our app. Think of it as getting treats for healthy gaming!
- Step Tracker: We're integrating a step tracker via the Google Fit API, so you can monitor your activity as you game.
- Access Everywhere: View your progress from your computer or phone. We're turning our site into an app and securing a domain.
